## Task 1: Introduction to Security Awareness

**Theory:**
Security awareness is the knowledge and attitude members of an organization possess regarding the protection of the physical and information assets of that organization. It's a critical component of cybersecurity, as human error is cited as a major contributing factor in a high percentage of successful cyberattacks. Security awareness is the responsibility of everyone, regardless of their role, as anyone can be a potential target.

## Task 2: Why Security Awareness is essential

**Theory:**
With the rise of remote work, the risk of cyberattacks has increased. Security breaches can result in significant financial loss (averaging millions of dollars per breach) and severe reputational damage. Security awareness training is a proactive measure that helps organizations prevent data breaches, reduce risks, and improve overall IT defenses. Studies have shown that such training can drastically reduce the number of successful phishing and malware attacks.

## Task 3: Data and Account Security

**Theory:**
Sensitive data is a primary target for cybercriminals. This can include personal information, customer data, financial records, and company secrets. Protecting this data is vital for both the organization and its clients. Major data breaches at companies like eBay and PlayStation serve as stark reminders of the consequences of failing to secure sensitive information.

**Question:** How many people were affected by eBay being hacked?
- **Answer:** `145 million`

**Question:** What data was leaked from Playstation being hacked?
- **Answer:** `Credit Card Information,Passsword`

## Task 4: Check if you've ever been part of a cyber breach

**Theory:**
The consequences of a cyberattack are severe and can include legal penalties, reputational damage, financial loss, and the loss of sensitive data. Threat actors can use leaked information from data breaches to launch targeted attacks. Services like **Have I Been Pwned** allow individuals to check if their email address or phone number has been compromised in a public data breach, which is a crucial first step in securing personal accounts.

- **Terrorists:** Motivated by ideological violence.
- **Thrill-seekers:** Motivated by the challenge and satisfaction of the act itself.
- **Insiders:** Individuals within an organization who are discontent and seek to cause harm.
