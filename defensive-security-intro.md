## 📜 Room Overview
Defensive Security — also known as the **Blue Team** — focuses on protecting an organisation’s IT infrastructure from threats.  
This includes preventing intrusions, detecting attacks in progress, and responding quickly to security events.

Throughout this room, we explored:
- Core responsibilities of defensive security teams.
- Digital forensics techniques for evidence preservation.
- The incident response lifecycle.
- A practical SOC simulation using a SIEM dashboard.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- **Blue Team** operations are proactive (prevention) and reactive (detection & response).
- **Digital Forensics** examines system memory, logs, and network traffic to investigate incidents.
- **Incident Response** follows defined stages: Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, and Post-Incident Activity.
- **Security Operations Centres (SOC)** act as the nerve centre for monitoring, detecting, and responding to threats.
- SIEM tools centralise event data and raise alerts for suspicious activity.
