# 🛡️ TryHackMe — Penetration Testing

> A complete walkthrough & notes for the **Penetration Testing** TryHackMe room.  
> Covers concepts, ethics, methodologies, testing types, and a guided practical.

## 📌 Room Overview
This room introduces the fundamentals of **penetration testing (pentesting)** — the process of ethically assessing a system’s security using real-world attack methods. It covers:

- **What Penetration Testing is**
- **Ethics & Legality** in pentesting
- **Industry-standard methodologies**
- **Testing scopes**: Black box, Grey box, White box
- **Practical**: Conducting a pentest on ACME’s infrastructure

## **Task 1 — What is Penetration Testing?**
A **penetration test** (or **pentest**) is an authorised attempt to evaluate the security of a system by simulating real-world attacks.

🔹 **Key points**:
- Uses the **same tools & techniques** as malicious attackers.
- Goal: Identify & fix vulnerabilities **before** they are exploited.
- Similar to a **security audit**, but more hands-on and exploit-focused.
- Example: Testing networks, web apps, cloud systems.

📊 **Fun fact**: Over **2,200 cyber attacks** occur daily — about **1 every 39 seconds**.

**📝 Questions & Answers:**
1. *(No answer needed for intro task)*

## **Task 2 — Penetration Testing Ethics**
Pentesting is **only legal** when done **with explicit permission** from the system owner.

### 🧢 Hacker Types:
| Hat Type | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **White Hat** | Ethical hackers working within the law. | Penetration tester with a signed agreement. |
| **Grey Hat** | Sometimes help, sometimes break laws. | Taking down a scam site without permission. |
| **Black Hat** | Criminal hackers for malicious gain. | Deploying ransomware. |

### 📄 Rules of Engagement (ROE):
Defines **how** a pentest is carried out:
1. **Permission** — Written authorisation to test.
2. **Test Scope** — Which systems & apps are in-scope.
3. **Rules** — Allowed & disallowed techniques.

**📝 Questions & Answers:**
1. You are given permission to perform a security audit on an organisation; what type of hacker would you be?  
   **Answer:** `White Hat`
2. You attack an organisation and steal their data, what type of hacker would you be?  
   **Answer:** `Black Hat`
3. What document defines how a penetration testing engagement should be carried out?  
   **Answer:** `Rules of Engagement`

## **Task 3 — Pentesting Methodologies**
Pentesting follows a series of **stages**:

1. **Information Gathering** — Collecting public info (OSINT).
2. **Enumeration / Scanning** — Discovering running services.
3. **Exploitation** — Leveraging vulnerabilities to gain access.
4. **Privilege Escalation** — Increasing permissions (horizontal / vertical).
5. **Post-Exploitation** — Pivoting, extracting data, covering tracks.
6. **Reporting** — Documenting findings & remediation steps.

### 🛠 Common Frameworks:
| Framework | Focus | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-----------|-------|------------|---------------|
| **OSSTMM** | Networks, telecom, wireless | In-depth, flexible | Complex, hard to read |
| **OWASP** | Web applications | Easy to learn, up-to-date | No formal accreditation |
| **NIST** | Cybersecurity standards | Widely adopted, accredited | Weak auditing policies |
| **NCSC CAF** | Critical infrastructure | Government-backed | New, less adoption |

**📝 Questions & Answers:**
1. What stage of penetration testing involves using publicly available information?  
   **Answer:** `Information Gathering`
2. If you wanted to use a framework for pentesting telecommunications, what framework would you use?  
   **Answer:** `OSSTMM`
3. What framework focuses on the testing of web applications?  
   **Answer:** `OWASP`

## **Task 4 — Black / White / Grey Box Testing**

| Type | Description | Knowledge Given | Example |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Black Box** | No internal knowledge | ❌ None | Testing like an outsider |
| **Grey Box** | Partial knowledge | ⚪ Some | Most common in pentests |
| **White Box** | Full internal knowledge | ✅ Full | Source code & architecture provided |

**📝 Questions & Answers:**
1. You are asked to test an application but are not given access to its source code - what testing process is this?  
   **Answer:** `Black Box`
2. You are asked to test a website, and you are given access to the source code - what testing process is this?  
   **Answer:** `White Box`

## **Task 5 — Practical: ACME Pentest**
💻 **Scenario**:  
You’re hired by **ACME** to perform a pentest on their infrastructure.  
Steps involve:
1. Reconnaissance (OSINT)
2. Scanning for vulnerabilities
3. Exploitation
4. Privilege escalation
5. Reporting

**📝 Questions & Answers:**
1. Complete the penetration test engagement against ACME's infrastructure.  
   **Answer:** `THM{PENTEST_COMPLETE}`
